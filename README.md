# Gun Game
This is a simple game where i tried to implement the concepts like Classes, Object creation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and etc. 
Here we have class Player1 Which has properties like name, gun and health. Class Player2 inherits Player1 and has armour in excess of properties inherited from Player1.
The methods damageGun1 and damageGun2 indicate the damage done by weapons to players and these methods are overridden in the Player2.
Player 2 has a method called heal which heals the health once it touches 0.
Next change to be made -> implementing a singleton class for the method  heal so that a player only heals once and is not immortal.
